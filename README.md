# Bug tracker
## Introduction
This project is a web based bug tracker system (similar to [Jira by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)) whose purpose is to show tech recruiters my technical skills for possible job opportunities.

## Demo
You can play with this project at [roysalazar.dev/app/bug-tracker](http://3.76.1.136/app/bug-tracker) (and see the roadman [here](https://jira.external-share.com/issue/43460/bug_tracker_board?groupBy=EPIC)).
