# Bug tracker
## Introduction
This project is a web based bug tracker system (similar to [Jira by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)) whose purpose is to show tech recruiters my technical skills for possible job opportunities.

## Demo
You can play with this project at [roysalazarbugtracker.dev](https://roysalazarbugtracker.dev) (and see the roadman [here](https://jira.external-share.com/issue/43460/bug_tracker_board?groupBy=EPIC)).

## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª About Me

Hi there! I am Roy.

I studied design at university and fell in love with 3D graphics. While working with 3D I came up with the idea of a "virtual sets marketplace" for filmmakers, but it would require me to learn to code, so I did.

The project didn't quite succeed but from this adventure, I became full stack developer in love with the idea of understanding problems and turning them into products.
